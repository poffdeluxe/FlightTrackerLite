FlightTrackerLite
=================

A teeny-tiny just-for-fun flight tracker that currently only works with Air China flights. 
This started as a simple way to keep track of one of my friend's flight as he flew home from Beijing. 

To use, modify for the config.json with the flight date and number.

##Upcoming Features
- Better handling of flight configuration data (not just from a faux JSON file)
- Multiple airlines! Not just Air China!
